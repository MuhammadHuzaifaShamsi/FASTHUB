<h1>**Introduction**</h1>
The Student Management System (FastHub) is an application developed in C. It has been
structured to strategically solve the critical problem by having very efficient and effective
tools to manage academics in an institution of learning. The system thus has functions
such as registering students, management of courses, determination of GPA or CGPA, and
generation of transcripts dynamically. With file handling and logical structuring, it ensures
persistence of data and reliability. This project combines some aspects of programming
concepts about user-defined functions, arrays, and conditional statements
to bring about a practical solution in streamlining academic processes
and increasing productivity among both students and administrators.

<h1>**Aim and Motivation**</h1>
The main objectives of the project were to develop an efficient, easy-to-use Student
Management System meant to manage important academic operations. The automation of
the system reduces exhaustive manual inputs about grades, transcriptions, and courses.

The motivation behind the need for this project arises from the increased demand for
digital solutions in education. This system takes inspiration from a need for reliability,
accessibility, and streamlined tools that can ease one's administrative burdens while
empowering students to manage their own academic data effectively and promptly.

<h1>**Background**</h1>
<h2>**Research and Project Selection**</h2>

The choice to develop FastHub stemmed from research on common challenges in
academic institutions, such as:
<br>
&emsp;• Difficulty in managing student grades across semesters.
&emsp;• Limited accessibility to personalized transcripts and academic data.
&emsp;• Lack of automated solutions for dropping courses and calculating GPA.
<br>
The project was selected as it offered a practical application of core programming
concepts like file handling, arrays, and user-defined functions in C, enabling us to explore
how such systems are built and utilized in the real world.
